# JSON File Translation Tool

This tool allows you to translate only the text sections of your JSON files into the desired language. By default, translations are made from English to Turkish.

## How to Use?

1. Rename the JSON file you want to translate to `language_file.json`.
2. Open the program. The translation process, by default, will translate from English to Turkish.
3. During the translation process, logs will be recorded in the `translation_log.txt` file.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the `deep-translator` module installed. You can install it using pip:
```pip install deep-translator```

## Output File

The translated file will be exported as `translated_language_file.json`.

## Example

In the example photo below, you can see how the program works:
